# JARVIS-VirtualAssistant

A virtual assistant coded in python that can open different files and folders on the system, social media sites like facebook, twitter; search information on google and wikipedia, play videos on youtube, lock pc, give time and weather updates, all over simple voice commands using speech recognition. This is actually very simple yet very interesting. I hope that this will help many people to learn and automate using python.
